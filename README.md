LMSNet: A Novel Ultra-Lightweight Model for Plant Disease Detection
Notice Regarding Source Code Availability
Greetings to all visitors, and thank you for your interest in our work, "LMSNet: A Novel Ultra-Lightweight Model for Plant Disease Detection," which we have proudly submitted to the esteemed IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation & Measurement (TIM) for expert review.

üîê Current Status on Source Code Sharing
In adherence to scholarly practices and out of respect for the integrity of the review process, the source code associated with our innovative LMSNet model is presently withheld. This cautious measure ensures the protection of our intellectual endeavors until the official acceptance of our manuscript by TIM, after which we will eagerly share our contributions with the broader research community.

üíé Commitment to Open Science
We are steadfast believers in the principles of open science and the value of reproducible research. With the green light from TIM, we pledge to promptly unveil the complete source code of LMSNet, accompanied by meticulous documentation and detailed instructions, empowering fellow researchers to replicate our findings and further advance the frontiers of plant disease detection technology.

‚è∞ Anticipated Code Release Timing
Following Acceptance: Upon the favorable decision from TIM, expect an immediate announcement and upload of our codebase, complemented by all requisite materials to facilitate your exploration into ultra-lightweight models for automated plant disease detection.

üì§ Stay Connected for Updates
